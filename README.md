POODR Chapter 9
===============

This tiny repo illustrates the testing principles in the ninth chapter of Practical Object-Oriented Design by
Sandi Metz. The original tests are written with Minitest. While these tests are easy to understand, it's
valuable to see the how they can be translated into RSpec syntax.

Each section has been put into a subdirectory with example tests and specs.
